                    <p>
                            OurTopAgent was created by real estate brokers for real estate brokers and real estate professionals. After years of testing numerous different marketing strategies and tools for our brokerage leads generation, we created a set of our own all-in-one tools that merged the best of the best strategies. We are now rolling out these tools to the public.

                        It literally takes minutes to create your profile. You can place a full order in under 15 seconds! There is no customization to do, nothing to upload. We take all the information directly from MLS.

                    <p>
                        We can even automate your mailers if you like and set everything up on autopilot.

                        The speed of delivery depends on the services you purchase. We submit your postcard for printing the minute you paid for your order. We offer two services, Standard can take up to 14 days and First Class will take about 5 days. Delivery times are approximate and depend on the USPS.

                <button class="accordion grey"><span>What happens when a lead is calling the number on the postcard?</span></button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        The phone number on the postcard is an Interactive Voice and SMS response IVR number. This was done so you never lose a lead. If they text, our system responds or if they call they have an option to connect to you directly.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand that you are not always available to pick up the phone every time they call. However, this is an expectation of the consumers now. If there is a call from a new phone number, we will send you a new lead notice as well as add other available information like address, name, and possibly even FB profile. All this information will not be added if they call you directly. It is like having an automated secretary to answer for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we send your lead your other URL, they would need to provide an email address to get more details.
