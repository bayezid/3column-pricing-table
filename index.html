                                        We generate your postcards using neighbor marketing lists, and provide you with a listing Lead Capture page. Leads captured on those pages are automatically sent similar listings for the property they inquired about. Not all leads are ready to transact, so we nurture those leads on your behalf.
                                        Neighborhood marketing lists can be used for customized mailers with unique lead capture codes, emails, and calls for the follow-ups. You can use the listing lead capture page to further market to the same people on social media for a total impact.
